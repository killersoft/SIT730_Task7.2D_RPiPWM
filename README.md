# SIT730_Task7.3D_RPiPWM
#This project/code uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects between 50cm and 5cm to the sensor
#and translates that information into PWM signals for an actuator
#Physical objects at 50cm will set the actuaor to -90 degrees and as objects get closer to the ultrasonic sensor will bring the actuator closer to +90 degrees
